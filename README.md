# Digit Recognition of Hand Written Digits of MNIST dataset - Part1

### Implemented Closed form SVM

### One vs Rest Classification SVM ( checking each labels with all other labels as a classification model )

### Manually computing Softmax Probability , Computing Cost function and Manually implemented Gradient Descent from scratch through deriving

### Principal Component Analysis and Projected data into higher dimension using Polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels

Achieved around 99% accuracy with cubic polynomial kernel of 10 dimension PCA using Softmax regression 

#### This is only part1 using ML . Part2 using Neural Networks will be up soon .
